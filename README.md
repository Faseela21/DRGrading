# DRGrading
Automated Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy using Ensembled Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing
and deep learning techniques to classify the stages of diabetic retinopathy based on fundus
images.An ensembled architecture called the E-DenseNet model can accurately diagnose
health conditions. Various DR grades from large and small ML color fundus images.
Combined the EyeNet and DenseNet models based on transfer learning. Adapted the
traditional EyeNet by inserting dense blocks and optimized the hyperparameters of the
resulting E-DensNet model.


Image processing includes:

Median Filter,
Histogram Equalization ,
Resize to standard size 256*256*3



DL Model:
Ensembled Convolution neural networks , pre trained DENSENET-121 & Customized EYENET architectures
